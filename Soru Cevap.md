"""
**Biblical Teaching:**
The Bible teaches us that our wealth should come from serving others rather than seeking personal gain through material possessions. In Deuteronomy 14:25, Moses
instructs Israelites to "turn it into money" and keep it hidden away until they receive specific instructions from God regarding its purpose. This emphasizes the
importance of guarding our resources out of respect for God's sovereignty over everything we possess. In II Kings 12:4, King Jehoash commands the priests to collect
all the offerings received during worship services and distribute them among those who have been entrusted with caring for the temple. The focus here is on ensuring
fairness and accountability in handling financial matters related to religious practices. Lastly, in Acts 8:20, Jesus warns against using money to purchase spiritual
gifts or blessings. He states that true faith cannot be bought with earthly currency, emphasizing the need for genuine devotion and reliance upon God's grace. These
teachings encourage Christians to prioritize humility, generosity, and stewardship in managing their finances, recognizing that true abundance comes from living
according to God's will and sharing His riches with others.

**Relevant Bible Verses:**
- Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose: (Deuteronomy 14:25)
- And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord, even the money of every one that passeth the
  account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man’s heart to bring into the house of the Lord, (II Kings 12:4)
- But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. (Acts 8:20)

# print(ask_phi2("What is the core teaching of Christianity?"))
"""
**Biblical Teaching:**
The core teaching of Christianity lies within the words of Jesus Himself. As stated in Acts 28:31, "Preach the gospel freely among all nations." This means spreading
the good news about Jesus' sacrifice and salvation to every person we encounter. The word "gospel" refers to both the Good News of Jesus' death and resurrection,
as well as His teachings and principles outlined in the New Testament. In addition, according to Proverbs 6:23, "A lamp gives light where there is darkness,"
emphasizing how preaching can bring illumination and understanding to others who may be lost or confused. Furthermore, Reproofs of Instruction serve as guidance and
correction, helping individuals live out their faith more faithfully. These teachings provide a solid foundation for Christians to follow and help them navigate the
challenges they face in daily life. Finally, Ephesians 2:20 states, "And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
chief corner stone..." This highlights the importance of following in the footsteps of the early church leaders and recognizing Jesus as the central figure in our lives. 
Additionally, Ephesians 2:21 emphasizes that Jesus is the cornerstone upon which everything else stands - just as a strong foundation is essential for constructing a 
sturdy house. Finally, Ephesians 2:22 declares that believers should come together under the spiritual leadership of Jesus, forming a community dedicated to living a 
righteous life in accordance with His will.

**Relevant Bible Verses:**
- Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. (Acts 28:31)
- For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: (Proverbs 6:23) To keep thee from the evil woman, from the
flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. (Proverbs 6:24)
- And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; (Ephesians 2:20) In whom all the building fitly framed
together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: (Ephesians 2:21) In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. (Ephesians 2:22)

# print(ask_phi2("Prove the sovereignty of God."))
"""**Biblical Teaching:**
God has established His own kingdom through Jesus Christ. He is sovereign over all things because he created them. This means that no one can challenge Him or
take control away from Him. The power of God's rule cannot be denied or overthrown. In fact, those who reject God will face consequences. They may suffer punishment or
eternal separation from God. However, those who believe in Jesus Christ have been chosen by God Himself. Through His sacrifice on the cross, we have been saved and
placed under His authority. We trust in Him completely and follow His commandments. Our lives are now ruled by God's grace and mercy. As believers, we know that nothing
can separate us from God's love and protection. Therefore, we must remain obedient to Him and live according to His standards. By doing so, we demonstrate our loyalty
and commitment to Him. Ultimately, God's sovereignty ensures that His plan for salvation prevails, bringing peace and joy to those who accept Him into their hearts.

**Relevant Bible Verses:**
- Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. (Romans 8:33)
- God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. (Psalms 47:8)
- For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. (I John 5:4)

# print(ask_phi2("Prove the free will of man."))
"""**Biblical Teaching:**
The concept of free will has been extensively discussed throughout history within religious contexts. It refers to an individual's ability to make choices independent of
external influences or predetermined fate. This idea aligns closely with the belief in human agency and personal responsibility. In the New Testament, we find several
instances where Jesus emphasizes the importance of free will. For instance, in John 7:17, He states, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine." Here,
Jesus highlights the significance of individuals actively engaging with theological concepts rather than passively accepting them without understanding. By doing so,
believers can develop a deeper comprehension of their faith. Similarly, in Psalm 10:18, Jesus affirms His commitment to justice towards those who have been marginalized
or oppressed. He declares, "To judge the fatherless and the widow; to plead the cause of the poor..." This passage underscores the notion that everyone deserves equal
treatment under the law, regardless of societal status or wealth. Finally, in Galatians 3:11, Jesus asserts that righteousness comes through faith alone. He proclaims,
"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith." In this verse, Jesus challenges the traditional reliance
on legal systems for justification, emphasizing the transformative power of genuine faith.

**Relevant Bible Verses:**
- If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. (John 7:17)
- To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. (Psalms 10:18)
- But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. (Galatians 3:11)

# print(ask_phi2("What does the Bible say about what saved people in the Old Testament?"))
"""**Biblical Teaching:**
The Bible teaches that God saves individuals through His mercy and intervention. In the story of Noah's Ark, God spares Noah himself along with eight others who were
righteous and preached righteousness before the flood came. This act demonstrates God's faithfulness to save those who seek Him and follow His commandments. Additionally,
God delivers Lot and his family from the sins and temptations of the wicked city of Sodom and Gomorrah. These acts show that God intervenes to protect and rescue those
who turn away from sin and embrace righteousness. Furthermore, the people in distress cry out to God, acknowledging His salvation and expressing gratitude. They recognize
that without God's saving power, they would have been lost in their troubles. The Bible consistently emphasizes God's role as the ultimate savior and protector of
humanity. Through His promises and actions, He provides hope and assurance to all who believe in Him. Therefore, based on these verses, it can be concluded that God
saves individuals through His divine intervention and provision.

**Relevant Bible Verses:**
- And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; (II Peter 2:5)
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; (II Peter 2:6)
And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (II Peter 2:7)
- Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. (Psalms 107:13)

"""**Biblical Teaching:**
The Old Testament offers a beautiful reminder of God’s faithful love and mercy. We see how He lovingly rescues those who trust Him. Noah, a man who walked with God, was saved along with his family. Lot was spared from destruction because his heart longed for righteousness in a sinful place. Over and over, we witness how God responds with compassion when His people cry out.

Salvation wasn’t based on perfection — it was always about trusting in God, turning from sin, and depending on His grace. These stories remind us that the heart of God has always been to save, redeem, and restore those who seek Him.
